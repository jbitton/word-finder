# word-finder

This project was made using React. Here's how to run the app:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jbitton/word-finder.git
$ cd word-finder/
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

To build the application, run `yarn build`.

**NOTE**: For those of you running the clean React app, ignore the index.php file. That's for a class project.
